## AWS Auto Scaling

### Introduction

AWS Auto Scaling is a feature that allows you to automatically adjust the number of Amazon EC2 instances in your application based on traffic demand. It ensures that you have the right number of EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application, optimizing performance while keeping costs low. This guide will walk you through the process of creating and configuring Auto Scaling for EC2 instances.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
1. **AWS Account:** Sign up at [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/).
2. **IAM User with Administrator Access:** This user should have full access to EC2 and Auto Scaling services.
3. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Typically, this is set up by default.
4. **Security Group:** A security group that allows the necessary inbound/outbound traffic.
5. **Key Pair:** A key pair to connect to your instances.

### Step 1: Launch an EC2 Instance

1. **Open the EC2 Dashboard:**
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Navigate to `EC2` under the `Services` tab.

2. **Launch an Instance:**
   - Click on `Launch Instance`.
   - Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). For this tutorial, you can use the Amazon Linux 2 AMI (free tier eligible).
   - Choose an instance type. For this example, select `t2.micro` (free tier eligible).
   - Configure the instance details:
     - Network: Select your VPC.
     - Subnet: Choose a subnet within your VPC.
     - Auto-assign Public IP: Enabled.
     - Leave other settings as default and click `Next`.

3. **Add Storage:**
   - Leave the default settings (8 GiB standard SSD).
   - Click `Next`.

4. **Add Tags:**
   - You can optionally add tags (e.g., `Key: Name`, `Value: MyFirstInstance`).
   - Click `Next`.

5. **Configure Security Group:**
   - Create a new security group or select an existing one.
   - Ensure the rules allow SSH (port 22) and any other required ports for your application.
   - Click `Review and Launch`.

6. **Review and Launch:**
   - Review your instance configuration.
   - Click `Launch`.
   - Select your key pair or create a new one, then click `Launch Instances`.

7. **Verify the Instance:**
   - Go to `View Instances` to see your running instance.

### Step 2: Create a Launch Template or Configuration

A Launch Template or Configuration is a template that specifies the instance configuration for your Auto Scaling group.

1. **Navigate to the Launch Templates:**
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, find `Launch Templates` on the left-hand menu and click on it.
   - Click on `Create Launch Template`.

2. **Configure Launch Template:**
   - Name your launch template (e.g., `MyLaunchTemplate`).
   - Provide a description (optional).
   - Select an AMI ID.
   - Choose an instance type (e.g., `t2.micro`).
   - Configure key pair, network, security groups, storage, and other settings similar to how you configured the EC2 instance in Step 1.
   - Click `Create Launch Template`.

### Step 3: Create an Auto Scaling Group

1. **Navigate to the Auto Scaling Groups:**
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, scroll down to find `Auto Scaling Groups` and click on it.
   - Click on `Create Auto Scaling Group`.

2. **Configure Auto Scaling Group:**
   - Name your Auto Scaling group (e.g., `MyAutoScalingGroup`).
   - Select the launch template you created in Step 2.
   - Choose the VPC and subnets where your instances will launch.
   - Configure load balancing options (optional). If you have an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), you can attach it here.
   - Configure the group size:
     - Set the desired capacity (e.g., 1 instance).
     - Set the minimum capacity (e.g., 1 instance).
     - Set the maximum capacity (e.g., 3 instances).

3. **Configure Scaling Policies:**
   - Choose a scaling policy:
     - **Target Tracking Scaling:** Keeps the group at or close to the target metric (e.g., CPU utilization).
     - **Step Scaling:** Adds or removes instances in steps, based on alarms.
     - **Scheduled Scaling:** Scales at specific times.
   - For this guide, choose `Target Tracking Scaling`.
   - Set the target value (e.g., 50% CPU utilization).

4. **Configure Notifications (Optional):**
   - You can configure notifications to receive alerts when scaling activities occur.

5. **Review and Create:**
   - Review your settings.
   - Click `Create Auto Scaling Group`.

### Step 4: Monitor and Test Auto Scaling

1. **Monitor Your Group:**
   - Go to the `Auto Scaling Groups` section to monitor your group.
   - Youâ€™ll see the number of instances increase or decrease based on the demand.

2. **Test Scaling:**
   - Simulate a load on your instances (e.g., by using a stress tool).
   - Observe how the Auto Scaling group adjusts the number of instances according to the policy.

### Step 5: Clean Up (Optional)

If you want to stop incurring costs:

1. **Delete the Auto Scaling Group:**
   - Go to the `Auto Scaling Groups` section.
   - Select your group and click `Delete`.

2. **Delete the Launch Template:**
   - Go to `Launch Templates`.
   - Select your template and click `Delete`.

3. **Terminate EC2 Instances:**
   - Go to `Instances`.
   - Select your instances and click `Terminate`.

### Conclusion

You've successfully configured AWS Auto Scaling for EC2 instances. Auto Scaling will help you maintain high availability and optimize costs by dynamically adjusting the number of EC2 instances based on the demand for your application.
