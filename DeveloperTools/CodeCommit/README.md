## What is AWS CodeCommit?

AWS CodeCommit is a version control service that you can use to privately store and manage assets in the cloud. It supports Git repositories, which means you can use it with your existing Git tools and practices. AWS CodeCommit is secure, scalable, and integrated with other AWS services, making it an excellent choice for teams working in AWS environments.

### Analogy:
Think of AWS CodeCommit as a "digital filing cabinet" for your code. Just like how you might store important documents in a secure cabinet, AWS CodeCommit safely stores your code and tracks every change made to it over time.

## Why Use AWS CodeCommit?

- **Security**: Your code is securely stored in AWS, benefiting from AWS’s robust security practices.
- **Scalability**: AWS CodeCommit can handle repositories of any size, and there are no limits on the number of repositories.
- **Integration**: It integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline for end-to-end DevOps workflows.
- **High Availability**: AWS CodeCommit is designed for high availability with a distributed architecture.


## Setting Up AWS CodeCommit

### Step 1: Set Up IAM for AWS CodeCommit

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the IAM service.

2. **Create an IAM User**:
   - Click on "Users" in the left-hand menu.
   - Click on "Add user."
   - Enter a user name (e.g., `CodeCommitUser`).
   - For "Access type," select "Programmatic access" to allow Git operations via the AWS CLI or SDK.

3. **Attach Policies to the IAM User**:
   - On the "Set permissions" page, choose "Attach policies directly."
   - Search for and select the `AWSCodeCommitPowerUser` policy to provide full access to AWS CodeCommit repositories.
   - Click "Next: Tags" and then "Next: Review."

4. **Create the User**:
   - Review the user details and click "Create user."
   - Save the IAM user’s access key ID and secret access key, as you will need them to configure Git on your local machine.

5. **Configure Git Credentials**:
   - Set up Git to use the IAM credentials by running:

     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

     - Enter the access key ID, secret access key, region, and output format when prompted.

   - Alternatively, you can create HTTPS Git credentials in the IAM console if you prefer using HTTPS over SSH.

### Step 2: Create an AWS CodeCommit Repository

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**:
   - Navigate to the AWS CodeCommit service.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click on "Create repository."
   - Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `MyWebAppRepo`).
   - Optionally, add a description to help identify the repository’s purpose.
   - Click on "Create."

3. **Repository URL**:
   - After the repository is created, you will see a URL for cloning the repository. This will be used to connect your local machine to the repository.

### Step 3: Set Up Git on Your Local Machine

1. **Install Git**:
   - If Git is not already installed on your machine, install it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Configure Git**:
   - Set your username and email address, which will be associated with your commits.

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   ```

### Step 4: Connect to the CodeCommit Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the repository URL from Step 2 to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://git-codecommit.<region>.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/MyWebAppRepo
   ```

   - Replace `<region>` with your AWS region (e.g., `us-east-1`).

2. **Add Files and Make Your First Commit**:
   - Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd MyWebAppRepo
   ```

   - Add your project files to the repository directory.
   - Stage the files for commit:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   - Commit the files with a message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **Push the Changes to AWS CodeCommit**:

   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

   Your files are now stored in the AWS CodeCommit repository.


## Using AWS CodeCommit in Real-Time Projects

### Project 1: Simple Web Application

**Goal**: Set up a basic HTML/CSS web application in AWS CodeCommit and deploy it using AWS services.

1. **Create the Web Application**:
   - Create a simple `index.html` file with some basic HTML content.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>My Simple Web App</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to My Simple Web App!</h1>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Push the Web Application to CodeCommit**:
   - Add, commit, and push the `index.html` file to your AWS CodeCommit repository.

3. **Integrate with CodePipeline**:
   - Set up AWS CodePipeline to automatically deploy your web application to an S3 bucket or an EC2 instance whenever there is a new commit in your CodeCommit repository.

### Project 2: Collaborative Development

**Goal**: Work with multiple developers on a Python project stored in AWS CodeCommit.

1. **Create a Python Project**:
   - Create a Python script `app.py`.

   ```python
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       return "Hello from AWS Lambda!"
   ```

2. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Use Git branches to manage multiple developers working on different features. For example, create a branch for a new feature:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature
   ```

3. **Collaboration**:
   - Developers work on their respective branches and push their changes to CodeCommit.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature
   ```

4. **Pull Requests and Code Review**:
   - Once a feature is complete, open a pull request (PR) in the CodeCommit console for review.
   - Other team members review the code, suggest changes, and approve the PR.
   - After approval, merge the branch into the `master` branch.

5. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Integrate AWS CodeBuild to run automated tests every time code is pushed to CodeCommit. If the tests pass, the code is merged and deployed using CodePipeline.

## Best Practices for AWS CodeCommit

- **Use Branches**: Isolate features, bug fixes, and experiments in separate branches to keep your `master` branch stable.
- **Enable Notifications**: Set up Amazon SNS notifications to get alerts for repository events like commits, merges, or pull requests.
- **Integrate with Other AWS Services**: Leverage AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Issues**: If you encounter issues with authentication, ensure that your IAM user has the necessary permissions to access the repository. You may also need to set up AWS CLI with your credentials using `aws configure`.
- **Connection Problems**: Ensure that your network allows HTTPS traffic to the CodeCommit service. If using SSH, make sure your SSH keys are properly configured.
