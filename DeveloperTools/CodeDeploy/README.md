## What is AWS CodeDeploy?

AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates the process of deploying code to a variety of compute services. It supports rolling updates, blue/green deployments, and can be used to deploy code to EC2 instances, Lambda functions, or on-premises servers.

### Analogy:
Think of AWS CodeDeploy as a "delivery service" for your code. Just like a delivery service ensures that your packages reach their destination safely and on time, CodeDeploy manages the process of deploying your application code to the right environment with minimal downtime.

## Key Features

- **Automated Deployments**: Automates the deployment process, reducing manual steps and errors.
- **Deployment Strategies**: Supports various deployment strategies including rolling updates, blue/green deployments, and canary deployments.
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and other AWS services.
- **Monitoring and Rollback**: Monitors deployments and supports automatic rollbacks if issues are detected.
- **Customizable**: Allows custom deployment hooks and lifecycle event scripts.

## How AWS CodeDeploy Works

1. **Application**: CodeDeploy deploys code to your compute resources. The application is defined in a revision, which is typically stored in Amazon S3 or GitHub.
2. **Deployment Group**: Defines a group of instances or functions that will receive the code. Deployment groups can be based on tags or Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
3. **Deployment**: Executes the deployment, following the deployment strategy and configuration specified.

### Analogy:
Imagine CodeDeploy as a "deployment coordinator" who follows a detailed plan to deliver your application to various destinations (e.g., servers, functions). The coordinator ensures that each destination receives the correct version of the application and that the process is smooth and reliable.


# Deploying Applications Using AWS CodeDeploy

This guide will walk you through the steps required to deploy an application using AWS CodeDeploy. This process includes launching an EC2 instance, configuring IAM roles, tagging instances, setting up CodeDeploy, and deploying the application.

### 5. Prepare Your Application

### Detailed Explanation of Each Step in Preparing Your Application for AWS CodeDeploy

#### **1. Install Required Software**

##### **Connect to Your EC2 Instance Using SSH**

Before you can deploy your application using CodeDeploy, you need to ensure your EC2 instances are properly configured. This configuration includes installing necessary software such as Ruby and the CodeDeploy agent.

##### **Install Ruby and wget**

```bash
sudo yum install -y ruby wget
```

**Purpose**:
- **Ruby**: The CodeDeploy agent, which is a small application that runs on your EC2 instances, is built using Ruby. Therefore, Ruby must be installed on the instance for the agent to function correctly.
- **wget**: This is a utility for downloading files from the internet. You'll use `wget` to download the CodeDeploy agent installation script from AWS. It simplifies fetching the installation file from AWS S3.

##### **Install the CodeDeploy Agent**

```bash
wget https://aws-codedeploy-<region>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto
sudo service codedeploy-agent status
```

**Purpose**:
- **Download the CodeDeploy Agent**: This command downloads the installation script for the CodeDeploy agent from an AWS S3 bucket that corresponds to your AWS region. The URL includes the `<region>` placeholder, which you should replace with your specific AWS region (e.g., `us-west-2`).
  
- **Make the Script Executable**: The `chmod +x ./install` command changes the script’s file permissions, making it executable. Without this step, you wouldn’t be able to run the script.

- **Run the Installation Script**: By executing `sudo ./install auto`, you install the CodeDeploy agent on your EC2 instance. The `auto` parameter configures the agent for immediate use.

- **Check the Status of the CodeDeploy Agent**: The final command, `sudo service codedeploy-agent status`, checks whether the CodeDeploy agent is running correctly. This is crucial for verifying that the setup was successful and the agent is operational.

**Why It’s Necessary**:
Installing the CodeDeploy agent is mandatory because it acts as a middleman between AWS CodeDeploy and your EC2 instances. When you initiate a deployment, CodeDeploy communicates with this agent to execute the deployment steps defined in your `appspec.yml` file, such as copying files or running scripts.

#### **2. Create and Configure an AppSpec File**

##### **Create an `appspec.yml` File**

```yaml
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /app
    destination: /var/www/html
hooks:
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/restart-server.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root
```

**Purpose**:
- **version**: This defines the version of the AppSpec file. For most purposes, you can leave this as `0.0`.
  
- **os**: Specifies the operating system of the EC2 instances. In this example, it's `linux`, but it could also be `windows` if you're deploying to Windows servers.

- **files**: This section maps source files (from your application package) to their destination on the EC2 instance. For example, the above configuration copies files from the `/app` directory in your application package to `/var/www/html` on the instance.

- **hooks**: These are scripts or commands that run at specific stages of the deployment process. For instance, in the `AfterInstall` hook, the script `restart-server.sh` is executed after the files are copied to the instance. This script could restart your web server, apply database migrations, or perform any other task required to finalize the deployment.

**Why It’s Necessary**:
The `appspec.yml` file is essential because it tells CodeDeploy exactly what to do during the deployment. It defines where your application files should go and what actions to take before, during, and after the deployment.

#### **3. Package Your Application**

##### **Create an Application Package**

This step involves bundling your application code along with the `appspec.yml` file into a single package (usually a ZIP file). This package is what CodeDeploy will use to deploy your application to the target EC2 instances.

**Steps**:
- **Create a ZIP File**: Package your application files and `appspec.yml` file into a ZIP file. This could be done manually, or you could automate it with a build tool or script.

##### **Upload the Package to an S3 Bucket**

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket-name> --region us-east-1
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <bucket-name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

**Purpose**:
- **Create an S3 Bucket**: The `aws s3api create-bucket` command creates a new S3 bucket where your application package will be stored. S3 is a scalable storage service that acts as a staging area for your deployments.
  
- **Enable Versioning**: The `aws s3api put-bucket-versioning` command enables versioning on your S3 bucket. Versioning is useful because it allows you to keep multiple versions of your application package in the same bucket, making it easier to roll back to a previous version if necessary.

##### **Push the Application Package to S3**

```bash
aws deploy push --application-name <app-name> --ignore-hidden-files --s3-location s3://<bucket-name>/app.zip
```

**Purpose**:
- **Push the Package**: This command uploads your application package to the specified S3 bucket and associates it with your CodeDeploy application. The `--ignore-hidden-files` option excludes hidden files from the upload, which is often useful to avoid including unnecessary files in the deployment.

**Why It’s Necessary**:
Uploading your application package to S3 is necessary because CodeDeploy retrieves this package from S3 when performing a deployment. S3 acts as the storage location from which CodeDeploy pulls the application files for deployment to your EC2 instances.

### **Do We Do This for All Applications?**

**Yes,** these steps are generally required for any application you want to deploy using CodeDeploy, whether it's built with React, Python, Node.js, or any other technology. 

- **For React/Node.js**:
  - You might include built frontend assets in the application package and deploy them to a web server.
  - For a Node.js backend, you could have scripts to install Node modules or restart the Node server as part of the deployment hooks.

- **For Python**:
  - You could include a Python virtual environment in the package and use hooks to install dependencies and restart the application.

The key point is that the `appspec.yml` file, package creation, and S3 upload are universal steps in CodeDeploy. The specific content of your package and deployment hooks will vary depending on the nature of your application.

### 6. Create and Start a Deployment

1. **Start Deployment**:
   - In the CodeDeploy console, navigate to your application.
   - Click **"Create deployment"**.
   - Select the deployment group created earlier.
   - Choose the revision (S3 bucket) for your application.
   - Click **"Create deployment"**.

2. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Track the progress of the deployment in the CodeDeploy console.
   - Review logs and deployment status to ensure successful deployment.

## Summary
